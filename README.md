# SDC Bank PHP API
===========

This is pretty much a direct port of the SDC Bank app built by my co worker Fas Mide [SDC Bank](https://github.com/fasmide/sdc-banking). All I did was port his discoveries to PHP to better support CLI usage.

## Requirements
1. PHP
2. Figure out what your bank nunmber is. I use 9090. I'm a customer in Sparekassen Thy (the url to my online bank is https://www.portalbank.dk/9090). Fas Mide uses 9380. He is a Sparnord customer.

If you figure out a way to get a list of these numbers please let me know.

## Usage
Add your credentials to main.php and run it - in a browser or via the CLI. The credentials are the same credentials as you would use for the "MobilBank" iOS app.
